          <h2>Past Experiences</h2>
            <p>The majority of my professional experience is in the Telecom Industry, with 7 plus years’ experience in the field. I have worked in a few different call centers within technical support/customer services for various carriers such as, Spectrum Business (formerly Charter Communications), and Verizon Wireless. I also worked for another carrier within their Tier II Telephony Trouble Resolution department which was at the time Insight Communications, but is now Spectrum Business. Currently, I am working for a Telecom Management firm called Tellennium Group, where I am the Lead Electronic Data Specialist. While I worked at Spectrum in their Day of Service and High-speed Internet call center I spent my time soaking in as much knowledge as I could expanding my computer skills immensely. I learned how to troubleshoot wide area networks, cable systems and greatly improved my social skills. During my time at Insight I was tasked with provisioning their Safari Switch for new and existing telephone customers. I also helped implement their transition from TDM Analog telephony switch to VoIP telephony switch within the Safari switch. I enjoyed my time at Insight very much because I was able to then apply my previous learned technical skills and greatly improved my telecom knowledge. I then moved on to Verizon Wireless when Insight was bought out by TWC and moved my position out of state. I worked for Verizon Wireless through a contract company named FirstSource. I did not spend much time with FirstSource but I did move up to a ‘floor walker’ within 2 weeks of being on the call center floor. I learned a great deal about the operations of a mobile network, how to troubleshoot mobile devices, and the complexities of data usage and data billing. I was then offered the position at my current job, Tellennium Group Inc., a telecom management firm. Here, I became the Lead of Electronic Data within a year. In this position I manage a team that inputs varying methods of electronic data into our billing software. Some of these methods include excel csv files, excel XML files, and the majority of our billing comes from utilizing EDI ANSI 811 delivery from multiple telecommunication vendors. I enjoy learning the ins and outs of EDI processing thru writing and troubleshooting logic & data strings to manipulate large quantities of data into a comprehensible billing invoice. My job allows me to utilize my extensive knowledge of telecom, while also challenging myself to learn more about new technology and pushing myself to always be actively learning.

          <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>I would like to become a software developer with a primary focus on C++ and .NET primarily. Ultimately, my goal would be to work remotely from our tiny home and travel freely with my family. As a family we hope to build our own 290 sq ft mobile tiny home for a family of four. I hope to reach these goals in the next 3-5 years. Before then I hope to get some real life experience in software development in my current job at Tellennium Group. They currently outsource their development to a company named Ignew, and they are very busy and do not have the proper time to develop new tools when they are constantly deploying hot fixes for one off issues. I would be step into a role to fix the one off issues from day to day, so that the Ignew team can develop new software for the company. Our software was built with C++ and .NET, so I am looking forward to learning those languages in the summer class if I can.
