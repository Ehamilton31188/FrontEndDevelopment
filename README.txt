My FrontEnd Web Development Final Project is a digital resume for myself. Displaying in the carousel a few images of my photography and drawing pieces, which will
be expanded more in depth in the backend class. Certain sections will showcase my past experience in various industries. Mainly highlighting my technical
experience developed thru different jobs I have had in the telecom industry. Also the site will display a form to send me their email address so that I can contact
them.
